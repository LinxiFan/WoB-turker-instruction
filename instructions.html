<p>Please think of a question whose answer will require some kind of web interaction. For example, one needs to do some searching and click a few buttons to find the best dining place on yelp.com. The answer should be visible on the webpage, i.e. it does not require complex reading comprehension or inference.</p>
<p>Please provide the website and write the question as a template with meaningful blanks. It can be any appropriate website or website subdomain as long as the question template is flexible enough. Be creative!</p>
<h1 id="walk-through">Walk-through</h1>
<p>First, enter the URL of the website, e.g. <a href="http://yelp.com" class="uri">http://yelp.com</a>.</p>
<p>Please make sure your website is <strong>mobile-friendly</strong>. You can test <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly">mobile-friendliness here</a>. Your submission will be <strong>invalid</strong> if the site doesn't pass the test.</p>
<p>Second, select a category for your website from the dropdown list.</p>
<p>Third, write down the question template with blanks. Please use parentheses &quot;( )&quot; to denote a blank. The words you write inside the parentheses should describe the meaning of the blank. Your question template should have at least <strong>two</strong> blanks. The more blanks the better!</p>
<p>For instance, enter your question template as</p>
<pre><code>What is the best dining place that serves (type of food) near (geographic location)?</code></pre>
<p>A table will be dynamically generated with column titles &quot;type of food&quot; and &quot;geographic location&quot; as you type out the template.</p>
<p>Please fill out the table to complete the questions. Please also write down the answers you find on the website in the &quot;ANSWER&quot; column of the table. A live preview will be displayed below the table as you type.</p>
<p>For example, fill out the table as</p>

<p>Website: wikipedia.org</p>
<p>Question template:</p>
<pre><code>Who is the (N-th) president of (country)?</code></pre>
<p>This is a bad template because the answer requires too much reading comprehension. In general, a page with very dense informative text, such as wikipedia.org, is not a good website for question templates.</p>
